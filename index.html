        <p>
          My name is Amalyn Baguio. I'm a working mom with two amazing son's, Prince 10 years old and
          Vicente III 14 years old and married to Vicente Baguio Jr. I'm originally from the Philippines and have
          been
          living here in Australia for 12 years now. I have been working with McDonalds since I was
          in Uni and upto this moment for about 16 years now.
        </p>
        <p>I am a BS Accountancy graduate but was not able to
          practice
          what I learned in Uni because I have been offered a job to become a Manager right after I graduated from
          University.
          I decided to do study again and learn new skill after 20 years, that is Web Development because I'd like
          to take new
          challenges in life when I still can do it and don't want to regret in the future why I haven't tried. I
          also would like to spend more time with my family on weekends which my current job is hard to do because I
          need to work over the
          weekends majority of the time. My boys are not getting any younger and I am missing a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to analyse and research and is very determined. I am very organised and a planner. I am hardworking
          and make sure that I am very productive with time given to me.
